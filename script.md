let's look at how you can use the component utility plugin.

When you're working on some kind of list, you often need to quickly iterate between several variation. What we usually do is, create and new master component and then create new instance from it, then feed the data into it, that's lot of work.

Instead, you can simply duplicate the artboard and select all the instances, along the master component and run the clone command. 

Now all these instances have been linked to this new master component, I can prove that by swaping the time. And the beauty is all these images, text data, styles, including the component variants will be preserved, such a huge time saver.

In some cases, you may already have a final master component and you have a frame with a bunch of instanceses that are linked to some other master component. In this case, you can select all the instances along with the master component and run the link command.

Now all these instances have been linked to this master component and of-course the images and other data has been preserved.


And one more thing, sometimes you may have a detached instance or a simply a frame that constitues all the elements from the master components. You can also link this frame to a master component.

Select both the frame and the master component and run the link command, the plugin will do the rest.

That's pretty much it, hope it helps...
